# File: .dockerignore
# Location: Repository root (same level as Dockerfile)
# Purpose: Tells Docker which files to ignore when building containers
# This makes your container smaller and build faster

# Git files (not needed in container)
.git
.gitignore
.gitattributes

# GitHub workflows (not needed in container)
.github/

# Documentation (not needed in container)
README.md
ROADMAP.md
LICENSE
*.md

# IDE files (not needed in container)
.vscode/
.idea/
*.iml
.project
.classpath
.settings/

# OS files (not needed in container)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.env

# Build artifacts that aren't the final WAR
target/
!target/*.war
src/
pom.xml
nb-configuration.xml

# App Platform config (not needed in container)
.do/

# Other common files to exclude
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
.npm
.nyc_output
coverage/

# What this does:
# 1. Reduces container size by excluding unnecessary files
# 2. Speeds up Docker build process
# 3. Improves security by not including source code or configs
# 4. Only includes the essential files needed to run your app

# Your container will only contain:
# - Base Tomcat image
# - Your bookstore-1.0.0.war file
# - Runtime configuration
